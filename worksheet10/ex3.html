                The used material settings were simply those of the default scene. A glossy pink sphere and a glass cube. 
                The elephant is loaded with the default textures from the mtl file. It might be a slightly boring scene but I moved the figures around to showcase more of the rendering featiures of the materials used.

                In terms of rendering parameters. I turned the number of bounces down to 10, this speeds up rendering quite a bit without losing too much quality.
                I also reduced the number of samples to around 200 as the rendering time was high for each frame.

                My main thinking is, that while drafting scenes in a third party tool is much faster, the actual rendering time is much slower.
                Blender is a diverse tool with many features, but it does not enable you to create any scene you want.
                While making one of the worksheets I made an error in the code that caused a sphere to get gain a half refracted, half reflected material.
                It is an example of something you could never do in Blender, as it is not a preprogrammed function.
                On the other hand, moving objects around, quickly shifting between textures, and creating lightsources is much faster in Blender.
                That type of workflow would be a pain to implement in code.
